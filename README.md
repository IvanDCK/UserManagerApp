## Introduction
UserManager is an application made with modern Android techniques in Jetpack Compose Multiplatform targeting Android and iOS.
It's main purpose is to provide an user friendly interface and ready to use app for creating new users, updating their roles and deleting them.

## Technologies
- Written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), using [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous operations.
- Jetpack Libraries:
  - [Jetpack Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-getting-started.html): Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for declarative UI development.
  - Lifecycle: Observes Android lifecycles and manages UI states upon lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data and is lifecycle-aware, ensuring data survival through configuration changes.
  - Navigation: Facilitates screen navigation.
  - [Koin](https://insert-koin.io): For dependency injection.
  - [Ktor Client](https://ktor.io/docs/client-create-and-configure.html): For making network requests.
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - Model - ViewModel)
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android?tab=readme-ov-file): Material design components for building UI components.

## Installing
To use the app properly, a backend server is required to handle all operations.

[Backend Server](https://github.com/AlejandroDCK/UserManager-Backend)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlejandroDCK/UserManager-Backend.git
```
[App](https://github.com/IvanDCK/UserManagerApp)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IvanDCK/UserManagerApp
```
Clone the repositories, start the backend server and run the app.
